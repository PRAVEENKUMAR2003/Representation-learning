# Representation-learning
  It's a research project.
# Problem Statement
  To create a novel model or training technique to overcome the problem of shortage of labeled data in image processing. 
# Current work 
  Experimented with a novel idea using Siamese network, utilizing a specific number of neurons for similarity and contrasting learning, while the remaining neurons for extracting other meaningful features using a custom loss function.
  Investigated the CNN's learning capacity on rotational invariance in image representations, exploring techniques to train models capable of recognizing objects regardless of their position and rotation.
  Explored representation learning in image processing using autoencoders on the MNIST dataset to extract meaningful features.
